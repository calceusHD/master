This is the code I  write for my masters thesis. It will be an hopefully efficient implementation of quasicyclic LDPC codes for FPGAs.
The hardware is written in VHDL and there also is a python implementation of the algorithms used. These were written to aid my understanding of the algorithms.
Some of the VHDL is generated using python for a specific parity check matrix (H).
